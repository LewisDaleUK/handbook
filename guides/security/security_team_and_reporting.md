# The Security Team and reporting incidents

## Who is responsible for Security at Made Tech?

Each team is responsible for ensuring that robust security practices are happening within their own team. This applies to delivery teams (Delivery Lead, Tech Lead, engineers etc.) and to business teams (Sales, People, etc.).

In addition to this, we have a Security Team who are responsible for ensuring secure practices are adopted across the business and that we continue to meet the standards required to acheive our security certifications (ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials +, etc.)

The Security Team ensures that:

 - Someone at Made Tech owns the responsibility for enacting, implementing, and improving our company security.
 - Security standards and objectives are set and maintained.
 - The Made Tech Team have recognisable individuals to report incidents to, discuss policy with, and support their continued improvement in adopting security principles.
 - Security events, incidents, and nonconformances are recorded and reviewed.
 
## Who are the Security Team?

The Security Team is made up of
 - **CSO (Chief Security Officer):** Chris Blackburn
 - **Security Manager:** Emily Thomas
 - **Security Consultant:** Colin Bycroft

## How to report an event or incident to the Security Team

An **event** is something that happens that could lead to a security problem e.g. the office door being left open. 

An **incident** is something that happens and DOES lead to a security problem e.g. the office door being left open an someone coming in and stealing a laptop.

Both should be reported immediately.

 - The report should first go to the Security Manager. The report can be made in person or via email, slack, phone call etc.
 - The Security Manager should then record the event or incident in the appropriate place and prepare to review it at the next appropriate time.
 - Where the Security manager is unavailable, the report should be made to the CSO.
 - Where the CSO is unavailable, report the event or incident directly to the CEO, who holds ultimate responsibility for security at Made Tech.
