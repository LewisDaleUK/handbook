# Reporting an event or incident to the Security Team

An **event** is something that happens that could lead to a security problem e.g. the office door being left open. 

An **incident** is something that happens and DOES lead to a security problem e.g. the office door being left open an someone coming in and stealing a laptop.

Both should be reported immediately.

## How to report:

 - The report should first go to the Security Manager. The report can be made in person or via email, slack, phone call etc.
 - The Security Manager should then record the event or incident in the appropriate place and prepare to review it at the next appropriate time.
 - Where the Security manager is unavailable, the report should be made to the CSO.
 - Where the CSO is unavailable, report the event or incident directly to the CEO, who holds ultimate responsibility for security at Made Tech. 

## What should I report?

A good general rule is that if anything feels like it *could* be unsafe, we'd rather know about it than not. As a guideline, here are some exmaples of things worth reporting:

- Finding an office door left open, even when you don't know how long it has been that way.
- Noticing a USB drive left out with no clear owner.
- Noticing customer data is being pulled into a public Slack channel via montioring, etc.
- Seeing someone unfamiliar in the main working part of the office without a Made Tech team member escorting them.
